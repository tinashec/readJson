Simple program to read a HAR (HTTP archive)json file and print to a file all the URL's the page has accessed.
The main thrust was to practice TDD (Test Driven Development). First a failing test was written, then the code implemented and refactored until the tests pass.
.json files gotten from HAR files after inspecting a webpage.
